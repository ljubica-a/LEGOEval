We will ask for your help by providing ratings on 15 statements taken from a conversation.\n\nYour responses to this HIT will be used as part of a research study. Participation in this research is completely voluntary. By accepting the HIT you consent to participate.\n\nImagine that the robot R is a friendly humanoid robot from the year 2060. R has two arms and two legs, and is capable of doing many things humans can do like riding a bike, cooking a meal, understanding complex math, and writing poetry.\n\nYou will be asked questions about responses R might make.\n\nYou must accept the HIT before continuing.",
